<p>Visualising home-based work
<br>
<br>What does home-based work look like in neighbourhoods, and how do family
dynamics, policies and neighbourhood amenities impact the ways people engage
in work? This workshop is based on our interdisciplinary project which
is concerned with the spatial, social and technological dimensions of home-based
work (HBW) in Singapore. By HBW we mean paid employment done in the home,
for non-domestic purposes. This includes home-based businesses (e.g. baking,
dressmaking,) and piece-workers, gig economy workers (e.g. drivers and
deliveries), and telecommuters (e.g. designers, data analysts). Our first
project objective is to chart and theorise the social geographies of HBW:
what is the policy framework surrounding this kind of work; who is involved
in it; what kind of living do they make; in which housing types and neighbourhoods
is this work happening? Next, we want to document local ecologies of resilience
and adaptability in HBW: both at home and within the community/neighbourhood.
Finally, we suggest pathways for accommodating HBW in our lives through
design and policy recommendations.
<br>
<br>This workshop will present key findings from our research, Q+A, and a
guided tour around the exhibition of data visualisations, models and drawings.
