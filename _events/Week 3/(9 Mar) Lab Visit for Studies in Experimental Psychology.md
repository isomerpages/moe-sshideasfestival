<p>One of the intriguing questions in Psychology is: How to decipher the
black box of human brain? For example, how do we process information? We
sense­­­ information through our sensory and perceptual systems, process
it further in cognitive system, influenced by our memory and learning as
well as past experiences, make judgment and decision, and take action or
inaction.</p>
<p>In a series of experiments, we infer this process by studying sensory
and perceptual inputs, cognitive process, and behavioural outputs in Psychology
labs through carefully controlled experiments and recording equipment such
as eye tracking and EEG. Please join us for the lab visit to experience
some of these experiments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
