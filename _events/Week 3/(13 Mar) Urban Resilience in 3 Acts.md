<p>How can a city stay resilient in a world of constant change — where AI
reshapes jobs, communities evolve, and climate risks intensify?</p>
<p>This SUTD-LKYCIC seminar explores Singapore’s urban resilience from three
perspectives: economic resilience, social cohesion and climate change adaptation.
Discover how workers can thrive amid AI transformation, how neighbourly
ties shape inclusive communities in mixed-income estates, and why rethinking
“resilience” and “adaptation” matters for tackling rising urban heat. Drawing
on a decade of LKYCIC research, the session invites all — students, residents,
policymakers — to rethink what resilience means today. Join this cross-sectoral
conversation on how we can prepare, adapt, and thrive together in changing
times.</p>
