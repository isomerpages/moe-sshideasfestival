<p>The history of Singapore’s urban centre is a showcase for resilience in
the island city. Its changing landscape is a direct reflection of the things
that have made Singapore, from the early port to the agricultural areas,
military and civic development, to the reclamation projects. Their development
has been the cornerstone of, and reflected, social and economic growth,
as Singapore moved through good times, and bad. Each of these socio-economic
shifts has left its memory inscribed into the landscape and with them,
a story.</p>
<p>Starting from Armenian Street at the front of SMU’s Yong Pung How School
of Law, this tour delves into the landscape under our feet, imagining a
Singapore as it was at different points in its chronology, from the agricultural
development of the nineteenth century, to the technological innovations
of the early twentieth century, to the Japanese occupation, and beyond.
This will be a predominantly social and environmental history, as opposed
to a classic national history, one which will tell lesser-known stories
from Singapore’s past and highlight parts of our history and landscape
that might be commonly overlooked. All these stories point toward one thing
however: resilience. Collectively they demonstrate that change can be viewed
in a positive light, even if it might not have seemed that way once.</p>
