<p>The world is going through a period of upheaval and facing many serious
challenges, whether from climate change, war, or new diseases. Societies
across the world are having to grapple with the difficulty of living in
the face of such adversities. In this cross-disciplinary symposium, we
raise the question of how design can contribute to fostering more resilient
forms of life.</p>
<p>Rather than treating design as a tool for erasing difficulty, we will
consider how it can cultivate the capacities, whether social, material,
and imaginative, that enable communities to endure, adapt, and even flourish
under pressure. This includes asking how design can scaffold mutual care,
create infrastructures that absorb shocks, and open up new ways of organising
collective life in uncertain times.</p><a class="isomer-image-wrapper" href="https://forms.office.com/r/Lamc6rGGYe"><img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Logos &amp; Assets/Registration_Button_v2.png"></a>
