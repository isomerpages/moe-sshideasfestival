<p>Artificial intelligence is reshaping the global environment in which legal
systems operate—not only by transforming how individuals, firms, and governments
act, but also by reconfiguring the broader political economy that sustains
them.</p>
<p>Resilience in this context means ensuring that legal systems can anticipate,
absorb, and adapt to technological disruption while continuing to deliver
justice, maintain legitimacy, and safeguard rights. Without deliberate
strategies for resilience, legal systems risk narrowing into brittle, tech-dominated
structures: constrained in their options, vulnerable to capture, and unable
to fulfil their core functions.</p>
<p>Engage with this panel that convenes experts across academia, government,
and industry to explore how law can remain a stabilising force in the age
of AI and to identify practical strategies for embedding resilience “by
design” into legal institutions.</p>
