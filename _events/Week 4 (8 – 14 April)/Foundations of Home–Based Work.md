<p>What does home-based work (HBW) look like in neighbourhoods, and how do
family dynamics, policies and neighbourhood amenities impact the ways people
engage in work? This workshop is based on our interdisciplinary project
which is concerned with the spatial, social and technological dimensions
of HBW in Singapore. By HBW, we mean paid employment done in the home,
for non-domestic purposes. This includes home-based businesses (e.g. baking,
dressmaking) and piece-workers, gig economy workers (e.g. drivers and deliveries),
and telecommuters (e.g. designers, data analysts).</p>
<p>Our first project objective is to chart and theorise the social geographies
of HBW: what is the policy framework surrounding this kind of work; who
is involved in it; what kind of living do they make; in which housing types
and neighbourhoods is this work happening? Next, we want to document local
ecologies of resilience and adaptability in HBW: both at home and within
the community/neighbourhood. Finally, we suggest pathways for accommodating
HBW in our lives through design and policy recommendations.</p>
<p>This workshop will present key findings from our research, Q&amp;A, and
a guided tour around the exhibition of data visualisations, models and
drawings.</p>
