<p>What are some of the challenges and opportunities presented by the changing
nature of work, the workplace, and the workforce? What are the possible
impacts these challenges and opportunities have on the well-being of workers?
<br>
<br>This roundtable brings together researchers from different disciplines
to share highlights of their different perspectives of work and the workplace,
and discuss their approaches and challenges of research in this area. Through
each of their research projects, researchers will share how their academic
research translates into meaningful involvement with research end-users
for mutual benefits, engagement with external stakeholders and public participation,
and collaboration with strategic stakeholders. They will also share how
academic research is able to create social impact beyond academia, such
as areas of health, public policy, culture, environment, economy and standards
of living, etc.</p>
