<p>Rapid advances in generative AI have intensified concerns about the harms
of “deep fakes” and other fabricated content. Beyond scams and election
manipulation, the flood of AI-generated material risks eroding shared knowledge
and social trust.</p>
<p>Yet misinformation is not a new problem. While technology accelerates
its creation and spread, the core response remains unchanged: individuals
must cultivate critical thinking rather than rely solely on regulation
or technology for protection. This informal talk explores how the legal
system addresses bad information through Evidence Law — for example, by
shielding juries from prejudicial evidence — and how these principles can
be applied in everyday contexts. By drawing on legal safeguards, the session
demonstrates how key concepts can strengthen critical thinking and build
resilience against information-based threats such as scams and manipulation.</p>
