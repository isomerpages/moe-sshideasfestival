<p>AI is a mirror and amplifier of our assumptions. If we do not stop to
question the ideas we bring into how we design and use AI, we risk carrying
forward the same problems from old education systems into the future.</p>
<p>"Speculative Future Frames" creates a space for experimentation and conversation.
It invites participants to go beyond optimisation and improvement of existing
systems, and instead engage in radical imagination to rethink teaching
and learning at the level of our assumptions. What if education was fundamentally
reconfigured? What would learning feel like, look like, and ask of us in
such a future?</p>
<p>Be part of this 2-hour in-person workshop that brings together cross-disciplinary
groups of participants to examine and deconstruct current assumptions about
higher education (such as grading, credentials, institutional structures,
and linear curriculum) and to prototype future frames through speculative
design.</p>
