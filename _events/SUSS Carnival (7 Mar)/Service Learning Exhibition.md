<p>How can young people and communities co-create solutions for a more resilient
future? This exhibition features some of the best projects from NIE301:
Learning with Communities at SUSS, where students work alongside government
agencies, NGOs, and corporations to address issues such as food security,
social inclusion, ageing, sustainability, and environmental conservation.
Through posters and student sharings, visitors can see how classroom learning
translates into real-world impact, and how service-learning nurtures not
only knowledge and skills, but also care, creativity, and responsibility
in building stronger communities.</p>
