<p>The adoption of AI in workplace in Singapore is in its nascent phase.
However, there are some industries and domains in Singapore where AI tools,
in the form of robotics, have been increasingly deployed and used.</p>
<p>This activity provides participants an opportunity to peek into the ways
service robots are being used in a variety of sectors such as customer
service and healthcare. It also allows participants to have some hands-on
experience controlling and engaged with these service robots' telepresence
and remote monitoring capabilities. Finally, there will be a discussion
and Q&amp;A for participants to consider the various challenges and approaches
to effectively organize AI and robots as part of human work teams.</p>
