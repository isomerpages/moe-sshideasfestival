<p>Perhaps the only thing clear about the future of work is its own uncertainty.
Yet, amid economic disruption and the rise of AI, public discussion has
mostly been limited to predicting available jobs and “employable” degrees.
This panel shifts our attention back to the question of work and its role
in social life. What will change in the everyday tasks we fulfil as workers,
and what meaning should we give to such efforts? What sort of career is
still worthy of human skill and emotion? How do we review a performance
when labor is partly outsourced to technology?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Featuring researchers from across Singapore’s universities, this panel
will discuss the changes and challenges in three major aspects of work:
care, creativity, and communications. In looking ahead, this panel explores
not only what jobs will likely persist, but how work must and should evolve.
Join us to reimagine the future of work!</p>
