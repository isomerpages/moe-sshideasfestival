<p>There is an increasing overlap between A.I. and the creative arts, whether
in music, literature or the visual arts. But what line should we draw (if
any) between machine and human creativity? Is it even possible for machines
to create art as we recognise it?</p>
<p>Does the development of A.I. mean we must rethink what art is? SUTD will
host a great debate between A.I. experts, philosophers, technologists and
practicing artists to answer these very questions and to debate the role
that A.I. can and should play in the artistic process. A customized A.I.
model, BOTicelli, developed and trained by SUTD students, will also participate
in the debate alongside real human faculty from SUTD and other universities.</p>
