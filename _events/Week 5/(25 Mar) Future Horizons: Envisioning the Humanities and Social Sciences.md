<p>Can the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) still shape the future in
an age increasingly dominated by artificial intelligence, climate crises,
and social fragmentation? Future Horizons: Envisioning the Humanities and
Social Sciences invites participants to reflect on this timely question
through two engaging panel discussions that explore the challenges and
emerging opportunities facing HSS today.</p>
<p>Bringing together scholars, practitioners, and thought leaders, the event
serves as a platform to exchange innovative ideas, foster collaborative
strategies, and reimagine the role of HSS in navigating the complexities
of the 21st century. Whether you are an academic, policymaker, student,
or engaged citizen, this is a call to action to reaffirm the vital importance
of HSS in informing ethical leadership, strengthening communities, and
humanising technological and societal transformation.</p>
