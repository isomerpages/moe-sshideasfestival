<p>The Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities (LKYCIC) presents a double
seminar featuring two presentations that shed light on interesting and
highly pertinent topics of our times. Join us for an exciting and insightful
session!</p>
<p><strong>AI x Workers: 10 Designs to Craft an Inclusive Future of Work.</strong> 
<br><strong>Mr Poon King Wang &amp; Dr Thijs Willems</strong> 
<br>If skills are the answer to Al's impact on jobs, why do so many questions
persist about workers' future?
<br>
<br>New strategies that extend beyond automation, augmentation, and even co-piloting
are essential. We show why and how, through 10 designs, we can craft meaningful
careers, transitions, collaborations, options, and trust in each other
and AI.</p>
<p><strong>An Eye to the Future or Back to the Future? </strong>
<br><strong>Dr Harvey Neo, Dr Samuel Chng &amp; Dr Sarah Chan</strong> 
<br>How far ahead do we think about what we think? While some people profess
to live in the moment, it is not practical nor possible to ignore the future
(or past). We think about the future in diverse situations, such as sourcing
for suitable health insurance or simply looking forward to celebrating
one's favourite holiday.
<br>
<br>Our presentation shares interesting findings from our population survey
on what Singaporeans think about the future, and offers behavioural insights
to perennial questions such as "Why are we unable to do things which we
know, and agree we should do?" and "Why do some people appear nonplussed
about existential issues which will affect their lives?"</p>
