<p>This panel seeks to expand, and deepen conversations around, and interventions
targeted at, the problem of fake news as artificial intelligence makes
it an even more formidable threat. With generative AI lowering barriers
to digital, visual, and audio editing, deepfakes and other types of AI-powered
manipulations will become more widespread and convincing. What can we do
to prepare our communities? This panel will bring together academic, policy,
and industry partners, focusing on three main areas:
<br>
<br>1. Examining the role of AI in exacerbating the fake news problem: This
session will delve into the ways in which AI technologies, such as generative
AI, can be exploited to create and propagate false information, including
the creation of deep fakes;
<br>2. Exploring AI-powered solutions for fact-checking and detection: This
segment will focus on the positive applications of AI in combating fake
news. Participants will engage in discussions about AI-based approaches,
algorithms, and tools that can enhance fact-checking processes, improve
the detection of misinformation, and empower journalists, researchers,
and the general public in their fight against fake news;
<br>3. Addressing ethical and regulatory considerations: This session will
critically examine the ethical implications of employing AI in addressing
fake news. Participants will discuss the importance of developing responsible
AI systems, ensuring transparency and accountability, and navigating legal
and regulatory frameworks to protect against potential AI-related abuses
and unintended consequences.
