<p>The Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities (LKYCIC) presents a double
seminar featuring two presentations that shed light on interesting and
highly pertinent topics of our times. Join us for an exciting and insightful
session!</p>
<p><strong>AI x Workers: 10 Designs to Craft an Inclusive Future of Work. </strong>
<br><strong>Mr Poon King Wang &amp; Dr Thijs Willems</strong>
</p>
<p>AI's impact on work and workers has come to the fore again. The discussions
however often fall short because they focus on a small subset of dimensions
of work (e.g. automation and augmentation). They overlook integrating the
multi-faceted dimensionalities of work and workers. For example, what makes
resilient careers beyond automation; the impact on&nbsp;the roles and interactions
between workers; the relationship between tasks and crystallised and fluid
intelligences that determine one's transitions etc.</p>
<p>Our presentation proposes to combine two approaches that overcome the
limitations of existing research, as they are both granular and integrative.
One uses big data with&nbsp;AI, algorithms, labour economics, and organizational
psychology that retains the human-in-the-loop to understand what workers
do in workplaces. The other uses thick data obtained through organizational
ethnography looking in depth at what workers do in the workplaces.</p>
<p>Using examples from our own research, we show what is possible with this
new approach. In the increasingly complex future of work, such integrated
and interdisciplinary approaches will raise the quality of research and
practice.</p>
<p><strong>An Eye to the Future or Back to the Future? </strong>
<br><strong>Dr Harvey Neo, Dr Samuel Chng &amp; Dr Sarah Chan</strong>
</p>
<p>While some people profess to live in/for the present moment, it is neither
practicable nor perspicacious to ignore the future (or the past, for that
matter). The idea of “future” is a recurring motif as we conduct our daily
lives. We think about the future in diverse situations and contexts, such
as sourcing for suitable health insurance against probable critical illnesses
or simply looking forward to celebrating one’s favourite holiday. The same
goes with other more elaborate goals, such as galvanizing the global community
to mitigate against future climate change impacts.</p>
<p>However, as alluded to by the three preceding examples, the idea of “future”,
though imperative, is both enigmatic and elusive. For example, what matters
in the future and the time frame in which a future is defined are not uniformly
understood across society.&nbsp;&nbsp; In a first of its kind study in
Singapore, we conducted a population survey to establish a baseline understanding
of how, why and what Singaporeans think about when it comes to their respective
futures.</p>
<p>Our presentation will share insights from the survey data and offers provocative
answers to perennial questions such as “why are we unable to do things
which we know and agree that we should do?”; “why do some people appear
non-plussed about existential issues which will affect their lives?”</p>
