<p>In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the importance
of mental health in Singapore, with the COVID-19 pandemic sparking more
open conversations about the measurable and immeasurable costs of poor
mental health. However, stigma against persons with mental health conditions
(PMHCs) continues to delay and even prevent, in some cases, help-seeking,
to deleterious effect.
<br>
<br>Stories have an impact on perceptions and experiences of reality. Even
well-meaning cultural text producers, such as television drama writers,
novelists, and playwrights, can inadvertently perpetuate stigma against
PMHCs through inaccurate or stereotyped portrayals of mental health conditions
(MHCs).
<br>
<br>This roundtable by NTU will introduce an SSRTG-funded project to develop
resources on mental health narrative ethical considerations for cultural
text producers in Singapore. These resources are being developed in consultation
with the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), based on close reading of local
mental health narratives, focus group discussions with PMHCs, and multi-disciplinary
and cross-sector roundtables with representatives from different industries
and communities, such as mental health professionals and writers.</p>
