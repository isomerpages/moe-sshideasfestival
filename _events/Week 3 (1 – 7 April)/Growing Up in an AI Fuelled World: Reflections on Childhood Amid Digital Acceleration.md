<p>From Animal Crossing to Bard and ChatGPT, childhood today involves a distinct,
technologically-charged set of ABCs. Children are using technology avidly,
consuming a vast quantity and mind-boggling diversity of media content
via growing array of devices that connect seamlessly to the internet. Indeed,
the household is the principal site of their formative media experiences,
and parents the key architects of their media environments. The bruising
Covid-19 pandemic further accelerated household adoption of online social
interaction, e-learning and myriad forms of digital entertainment – all
underpinned by AI.</p>
<hr>
<p>
<br>What are the promises and pitfalls in children’s technology use in an
AI-fuelled world that boasts of disruptive innovations such as the metaverse
and generative AI? Immersive and interactive augmented reality environments
present engaging and highly customized learning experiences for children.
But these may come at the cost of excessive screentime and device dependency.
Social media platforms may be able to detect when children are consuming
questionable content and send alerts to parents. Yet this needs to be weighed
against reduced control over personal data and children’s rights to autonomy
and agency. Growing up in a world marked by digital acceleration certainly
presents many quandaries to parents and children but possibilities as well.</p>
<hr>
<p>
<br>This talk will draw on humanities and social sciences research on the
social implications of AI to discuss the challenges and opportunities parents
and children face as the deployment of AI intensifies rapidly. It will
also touch on how parents can seek to boost their own and their children’s
understanding of the implications of the rising prevalence of AI. It will
close by highlighting resources that can support parents and children through
these disruptions.</p>
<hr>
<p>A Q&amp;A session moderated by Jiow Hee Jhee, a parent, member of the
Media Literacy Council and Associate Professor at the Singapore Institute
of Technology, will follow the talk.</p>
