<p>We are entering a new era of global trade (dis)order, shaped by powerful
waves of technological and economic disruption. From generative AI transforming
production and services, to tariff escalations redrawing trade routes,
these shifts are reconfiguring the foundations of international commerce.
They bring real opportunities—efficiency gains from emerging technologies,
new markets, and innovative business models—but also serious challenges,
including fragmentation, heightened uncertainty, and systemic complexity.
Together, these dynamics underscore the urgent need for resilience.</p>
<p>Bringing together diverse perspectives, this event will explore how businesses
and other actors in the region can adapt to and navigate this fast-changing
landscape. Key questions include: How can we better understand and prepare
for emerging trends? Do these disruptions challenge our long-held assumptions?
And how can actors remain resilient and agile in the face of volatility?
Join us to exchange insights, build partnerships, and shape resilient strategies
for a more inclusive and adaptive global economy. Joint efforts among businesses,
policymakers, innovators, consumers, NGOs, and the broader community are
essential to build resilience and drive sustained and inclusive growth.</p>
