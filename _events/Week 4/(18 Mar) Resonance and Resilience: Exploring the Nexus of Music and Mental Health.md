<p>How can the arts – particularly music – support resilience and mental
well-being in a rapidly changing world? This panel discussion, hosted by
Peter Tay, psychologist in the Health and Social Sciences Cluster at SIT,
brings together insights from his collaborative research with The TENG
Company on the therapeutic potential of music. Their study, conducted with
undergraduate students, working adults, and seniors, highlights how sound
and rhythm can ease anxiety and promote emotional well-being.</p>
<p>Attendees will not only engage in dialogue about the intersection of music
and health but also experience the effects of auditory stimulation in an
immersive session. The panel will explore practical ways to deepen connections
between creative expression and healthcare, sparking ideas for how music
can be harnessed to help individuals and communities to flourish.</p>
