<p>How do we build communities that bounce back from crisis and adapt to
constant change?
<br>&nbsp;
<br>From climate disruptions to social fragmentation, today's challenges demand
more than good policies—they require understanding how people actually
make decisions. Resilient societies aren't built on perfect plans; they're
built on small, smart nudges that help individuals make better choices
for themselves and their communities.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>ThriveLab is a high-energy, half-day "nudgathon" where you'll apply behavioural
economics and psychology to design real-world interventions. Working in
teams, you'll tackle pressing issues—from encouraging sustainable habits
to improving mental health support—creating evidence-based solutions that
strengthen our collective capacity to thrive.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>No textbooks or lectures—just hands-on problem-solving that shows you
how academic insights translate into tangible impact. Whether you're exploring
career paths in policy, social innovation, or simply want to make a difference,
you'll leave with practical skills and a prototype ready for the real world.</p>
