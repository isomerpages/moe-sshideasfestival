<p>In a world where anyone can publish anything easily online, how do we
know what and whom to trust? From viral rumors to fake news to AI-generated
deepfakes, today’s information ecosystem is increasingly shaped by speed,
hype, and unknown agendas. This seminar covers misinformation and disinformation,
showing how false content spreads, why we fall for it, and emerging research
about combating digital deception.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Join us as we explore these issues to strengthen information resilience.
Our panel of experts will discuss cutting-edge work on verification, fact-checking,
media literacy, and the human behaviours that allow falsehoods to thrive.
If you are an everyday media user, parent, educator, or simply curious
about fighting falsehoods, this seminar is for you.</p>
