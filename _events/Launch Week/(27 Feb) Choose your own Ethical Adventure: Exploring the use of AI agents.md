<p>All professionals face ethical conundrums in their field, however in healthcare,
ethical considerations are integral to every aspect of healthcare practice,
where clinicians act not only as providers of care but also as moral agents.</p>
<p>Each clinical encounter presents potential dilemmas with significant consequences
for patients, families, and society. While educators use established frameworks
to guide ethical reasoning, practice often reveals persistent ambiguity
and complexity. This workshop examines how emerging AI agents can support
students and practitioners in navigating these “grey zones.”</p>
<p>By clarifying conflicting values and drawing on real-world case scenarios,
participants will explore the personal, professional, moral, and cultural
dimensions of ethical decision-making. Interactive discussions and demonstrations
will illustrate how AI-assisted tools can enhance ethical reasoning and
complement traditional teaching approaches.</p>
