<p>As Singapore faces a rapidly ageing population, it is imperative to find
sustainable ways to support active, connected and inclusive communities
for all ages. Arts- and design-led community initiatives are serve as powerful
platforms that promote active participation, self-expression and wellbeing.
Additionally, the arts are an effective medium for intercultural, intergenerational
and inclusive learning that facilitates meaningful interactions, promoting
mutual understanding, respect and cultural exchange.
<br>
<br>Through an interactive case study sharing of NAFA's GLab initiative by
industry stakeholders, participants will explore the transformative power
of arts- and design-led community programmes that foster inclusive learning
and engagement. Participants will also learn more about the fundamental
considerations behind embarking on creative community programmes, as well
as the research methodologies employed to map and evaluate impact.
<br>
<br>Join us to be enriched with insights on conducting engaged research that
advances the value of the arts and creativity for more connected and resilient
communities.&nbsp;</p>
