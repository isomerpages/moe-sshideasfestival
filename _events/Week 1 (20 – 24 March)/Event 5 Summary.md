<p>From Animal Crossing to Bard and ChatGPT, childhood today involves a distinct,
technologically-charged set of ABCs. Children are using technology avidly,
consuming a vast quantity and mind-boggling diversity of media content
via growing array of devices that connect seamlessly to the internet. Indeed,
the household is the principal site of their formative media experiences,
and parents the key architects of their media environments.</p>
<p>The bruising Covid-19 pandemic further accelerated household adoption
of online social interaction, e-learning and myriad forms of digital entertainment
– all underpinned by AI. What are the promises and pitfalls in children’s
technology use in an AI-fuelled world that boasts of disruptive innovations
such as the metaverse and generative AI? Immersive and interactive augmented
reality environments present engaging and highly customized learning experiences
for children. But these may come at the cost of excessive screentime and
device dependency. Social media platforms may be able to detect when children
are consuming questionable content and send alerts to parents. Yet this
needs to be weighed against reduced control over personal data and children’s
rights to autonomy and agency. Growing up in a world marked by digital
acceleration certainly presents many quandaries to parents and children
but possibilities as well.</p>
<p>This talk will draw on humanities and social sciences research on the
social implications of AI to discuss the challenges and opportunities parents
and children face as the deployment of AI intensifies rapidly. It will
also touch on how parents can seek to boost their own and their children’s
understanding of the implications of the rising prevalence of AI. It will
close by highlighting resources that can support parents and children through
these disruptions. A question and answer session moderated by a parent
who serves on the Media Literacy Council will follow the talk.</p>
