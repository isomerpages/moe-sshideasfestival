<p>Time: 4.00 - 5.30pm</p>

<p>Join us as we glimpse into the metaverse and the computer-generated worlds
that are now in development. Organised by the Asia Research Institute (ARI),
this Roundtable will consider the key questions, implications and themes
that researchers in the social sciences and humanities are now asking about
this next stage in our digital journey, particularly in Asia</p>
<p>Discussion Themes include:</p>
