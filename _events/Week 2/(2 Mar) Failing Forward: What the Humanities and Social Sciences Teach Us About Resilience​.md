<p>What if failure isn't the opposite of success, but a crucial stepping
stone toward it?</p>
<p>Across the humanities and social sciences, scholars have long studied
how setbacks shape human behavior, innovation, and growth. Yet in achievement-oriented
societies, failure remains stigmatized—something to hide rather than harness.</p>
<p>This panel discussion brings together diverse disciplinary perspectives
to reframe failure as a learning opportunity. Discover how psychologists
understand resilience-building, how historians trace innovation born from
setbacks, and how sociologists examine cultural attitudes toward "failing
forward."</p>
<p>Whether you're navigating career challenges, academic pressures, or personal
growth, you'll leave with practical strategies to build grit, embrace productive
failure, and transform obstacles into opportunities. Learn why your biggest
setbacks might become your greatest assets.</p>
