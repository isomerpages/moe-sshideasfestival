<p>When illness strikes, we often speak of “fighting” disease and “staying
strong.” But what does resilience really mean in the hospital ward? Is
it an empowering ideal or can it sometimes obscure pain, dependence, and
vulnerability?</p>
<p>This interactive event brings together patients, caregivers, medical practitioners,
humanities scholars, and medical educators to reflect on how resilience
is lived, narrated, and cared for. Through short talks, creative exhibits,
and digital displays by students and clinicians, audiences will encounter
diverse perspectives on healing from the power and limits of battle metaphors
to the practice of mindful compassion in medical education.</p>
<p>Join us to reimagine care beyond stoicism and strength, and to hear authentic
voices that reveal what it truly means to endure, adapt, and find meaning
in illness.</p>
