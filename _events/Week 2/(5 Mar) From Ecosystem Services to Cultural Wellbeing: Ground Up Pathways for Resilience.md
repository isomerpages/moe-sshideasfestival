<p>How can the ways we value and experience nature strengthen wellbeing and
resilience in our urban lives? This session introduces the concept of Cultural
Ecosystem Services (CES) — the non-material benefits people gain from nature,
such as identity, belonging, and connection. It explores how these often-overlooked
cultural and emotional dimensions of nature can guide us toward building
more resilient communities.</p>
<p>These ideas come into focus through the work of Terrapy SG, a community-focused
and socially driven enterprise dedicated to harnessing horticultural therapy
and other nature-based interventions to support diverse populations. Participants
will take part in hapa zome (leaf pounding), a therapeutic horticulture
activity that exemplifies how CES — including aesthetic appreciation, cultural
expression, and social connection — can be activated through creative interaction
with plants to promote holistic health and wellbeing.</p><a class="isomer-image-wrapper" href="https://tinyurl.com/nafauas-ecosystem"><img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Logos &amp; Assets/Registration_Button_v2.png"></a>
