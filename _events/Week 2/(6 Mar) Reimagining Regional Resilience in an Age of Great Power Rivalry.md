<p>How should Singapore and Southeast Asia navigate an increasingly complex
and volatile strategic landscape?</p>
<p>The region is not only contending with enduring hard security risks—such
as military conflict, territorial disputes, and strategic rivalry—but is
also being reshaped by transboundary challenges including economic disruptions,
pandemics, cyber vulnerabilities, and uneven demographic transitions. The
convergence of these strategic challenges requires a fundamental re-examination
of ASEAN's regional resilience.</p>
<p>This half-day event consists of two inter-varsity and interdisciplinary
panels: (1) emerging orders and institutions; and (2) technology and global
value chain resilience.</p>
