<p>How can policymakers and pension administrators make old-age pension systems
more financially resilient in developing and developed countries? What
is the role of financial literacy in retirement and economic decision-making?</p>
<p>This poster exhibition presents a selection of student-led, Asia-focused
research projects carried out as part of the graduate coursework for the
""Pensions &amp; Retirement Policies"" module, alongside new findings from
national surveys on financial literacy and financial capability in Singapore.
The 2-week exhibition serves as an open platform for sharing applied research
and for fostering critical reflection on addressing financial resilience
in retirement systems.</p>
<p>Join us for evidence-based insights on the topic. Guests will have the
opportunity to engage "live" with the students and researchers from 2-5pm
on 4 &amp; 9 March.</p>
