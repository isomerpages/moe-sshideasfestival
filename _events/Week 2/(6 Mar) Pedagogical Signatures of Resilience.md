<p>How can we reimagine resilience?</p>
<p>This roundtable brings together veteran&nbsp;artist-educators from music,
dance, and theatre to explore how resilience is cultivated as a multifaceted
pedagogical disposition in the performing arts. Participants will share
lived experiences, discuss contemporary teaching approaches, and examine
learning challenges in navigating ambiguity, uncertainty, and vulnerability.
Drawing on insights from performance practices, the session will highlight
how resilience has been intentionally fostered in our higher education
curricula, and how these practices can extend beyond the classroom to benefit
learners, educators, and society at large.</p>
<p>We invite dialogue, collaboration, and reflection on how the performing
arts can help students in all majors recognise multiple employment possibilities,
to inspire resilient, creative communities for the future.</p>
<p>The roundtable will include performances and demonstrations by music,
dance and theatre students from the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, University
of the Arts Singapore. A closing work, titled <em>Here, There &amp; Fly&nbsp;Where?</em>,&nbsp;reimagines
flight attendants through various Afro-dance styles with contemporary and
street elements.&nbsp;</p>
