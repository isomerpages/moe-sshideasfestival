<p>How can we reimagine resilience?</p>
<p>This roundtable brings together artist-educators from music, dance, and
theatre to explore how resilience is cultivated as a multifaceted pedagogical
disposition in the performing arts. Participants will share lived experiences,
discuss contemporary teaching approaches, and examine learning challenges
in navigating ambiguity, uncertainty, and vulnerability. Drawing on insights
from performance practices, the session will highlight how resilience has
been intentionally fostered in our higher education curricula, and how
these practices can extend beyond the classroom to benefit learners, educators,
and society at large.</p>
<p>We invite dialogue, collaboration, and reflection on how the performing
arts can help students in all majors recognise multiple employment possibilities,
to inspire resilient, creative communities for the future."adapt, and find
meaning in illness."</p>
