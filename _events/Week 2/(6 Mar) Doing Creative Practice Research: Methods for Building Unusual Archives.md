<p>Creative practice research enables the discovery of knowledge that is
emotive, embodied, and sensory. More importantly, it provides exciting
points of entry for the public to engage in dialogue with the research
beyond traditional academic texts.&nbsp; Creative practice research has
increasingly been adopted to generate new knowledge and perspectives not
only in the arts but also across the social sciences and traditional STEM
fields. In many countries, research policies and funding now include the
consideration of creative practice or artistic research.
<br>
<br>This workshop demonstrates creative practice research methodologies by
working with materials that have potential for the telling of invisible
stories. The workshop will provide an opportunity to write and discuss
the banal, the everyday, and the vernacular through paying attention to
voices, objects, and artefacts that are not normally thought of as traditionally
archival or having formal archival potential. The workshop facilitators
will provide examples from their own creative practice research.
<br>
<br>This workshop is designed for researchers keen on partnering with creative
practice researchers and for students and their supervisors working on
creative practice research.&nbsp;</p>
