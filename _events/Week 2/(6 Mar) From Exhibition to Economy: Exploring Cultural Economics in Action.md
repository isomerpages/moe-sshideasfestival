<p>Join us for an interactive workshop that focuses on cultural valuation,
where we will explore the vital intersections of culture and economics
to explore the multifaceted importance of the arts beyond monetary measures.
As we navigate today's interconnected challenges that are threatening both
human and planetary wellbeing, there have been calls for a more sustainable
future by rethinking ideas of growth and value. Through an exhibition visit
and dialogical workshop, participants will uncover varying perspectives
and definitions of what cultural assets like exhibitions mean to them and
others.&nbsp; By engaging in these conversations and reflections, participants
will experience first-hand how the arts and cultural economics can expand
our understanding of value that can be foundational to a more inclusive
and resilient future.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Whether you are interested in the arts, policy or cultural economics,
this workshop aims to foster a deeper appreciation of the intrinsic and
instrumental value of the arts and culture in society.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Don’t miss this opportunity to expand your perspectives, challenge assumptions
and deepen your understanding of cultural economics!</p>
