<p>Join us for an interactive workshop that focuses on cultural valuation,
where we will explore the vital intersections of culture and economics
to explore the multifaceted importance of the arts beyond monetary measures.</p>
<p>Whether you are interested in the arts, policy or cultural economics,
this workshop aims to foster a deeper appreciation of the intrinsic and
instrumental value of the arts and culture in society.</p>
<p>Don’t miss this opportunity to expand your perspectives, challenge assumptions
and deepen your understanding of cultural economics!</p>
