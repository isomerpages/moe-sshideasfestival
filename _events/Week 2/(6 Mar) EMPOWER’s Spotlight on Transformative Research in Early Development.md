<p>EMPOWER will showcase three key projects. The first identifies neural
hallmarks of effective teacher–child interactions that shape executive
function development and school readiness in both typically developing
children and those at risk for ASD or ADHD.</p>
<p>The second advances digital learning through live, contingent interaction
studies and a personalised avatar that mitigates the “video deficit” for
young learners.</p>
<p>The third highlights the Playpod project, a community-based, scalable
screening tool from the Wellcome LEAP 1kD programme, designed to support
healthy infant brain development through accessible, play-based assessments
and early identification of developmental needs.</p>
