<p>What does it look like when a population health approach is adopted on
campus? At the Singapore Management University, the SMU Resilience Framework
has been adopted to promote students’ holistic wellbeing. Resilience has
been shown to be positively correlated with positive indicators of mental
health, such as life satisfaction and subjective well-being.</p>
<p>The SMU Resilience Framework redefines the landscape of student wellbeing.
By shifting upstream from intervention to cultivation, SMU equips students
with life-skills that empower them to take ownership of their holistic
and life-long wellbeing. This session unpacks how the framework has been
implemented by integrating purposeful outreach, innovative programming,
and collaborative partnerships both within and beyond campus.</p>
<p>Join us to discover how a culture of care is embedded into campus life,
where we help students find their footing to succeed, engendering pathways
to a life of flourishing. Don’t miss this opportunity to be part of the
movement toward holistic student wellbeing!</p>
