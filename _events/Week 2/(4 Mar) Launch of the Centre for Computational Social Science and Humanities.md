<p><strong>How can computational tools revolutionise the way we understand society, culture, and human behaviour? </strong>Join
us for the official launch of the NUS Centre for Computational Social Science
and Humanities (CSSH), a new interdisciplinary initiative that brings together
the methods of computing with the questions and insights of the social
sciences and humanities. Serving as a vibrant nexus for innovation and
collaboration, CSSH aims to advance research that bridges data, technology,
and human experience.</p>
<p>This launch marks the beginning of an exciting platform for scholars,
students, and practitioners to explore new frontiers in knowledge creation
and redefine what it means to study society in the digital age.</p>
