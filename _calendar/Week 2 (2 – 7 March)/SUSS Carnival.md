<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>The adoption of AI in workplace in Singapore is in its nascent phase.
However, there are some industries and domains in Singapore where AI tools,
in the form of robotics, have been increasingly deployed and used. This
activity provides participants an opportunity to peek into the ways service
robots are being used in a variety of sectors such as customer service
and healthcare. It also allows participants to have some hands-on experience
controlling and engaged with these service robots' telepresence and remote
monitoring capabilities. Finally, there will be a discussion and Q&amp;A
for participants to consider the various challenges and approaches to effectively
organize AI and robots as part of human work teams.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How can young people and communities co-create solutions for a more resilient
future? This exhibition features some of the best projects from NIE301:
Learning with Communities at SUSS, where students work alongside government
agencies, NGOs, and corporations to address issues such as food security,
social inclusion, ageing, sustainability, and environmental conservation.
Through posters and student sharings, visitors can see how classroom learning
translates into real-world impact, and how service-learning nurtures not
only knowledge and skills, but also care, creativity, and responsibility
in building stronger communities.</p>

<p>The Neuroscience of Stress and Coping Strategies invites participants
to explore how the brain responds under pressure, focusing on key regions
like the prefrontal cortex and amygdala. Through interactive, hands-on
activities and neuroimaging demonstrations, the session makes complex neuroscience
accessible while highlighting practical strategies for building resilience.</p>

<p><strong>Enhancing Critical Thinking with Lessons from Evidence Law</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>2.00pm - 3.30pm</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Rapid advances in generative AI have intensified concerns about the harms
of “deep fakes” and other fabricated content. Beyond scams and election
manipulation, the flood of AI-generated material risks eroding shared knowledge
and social trust. Yet misinformation is not a new problem. While technology
accelerates its creation and spread, the core response remains unchanged:
individuals must cultivate critical thinking rather than rely solely on
regulation or technology for protection. This informal talk explores how
the legal system addresses bad information through Evidence Law — for example,
by shielding juries from prejudicial evidence — and how these principles
can be applied in everyday contexts. By drawing on legal safeguards, the
session demonstrates how key concepts can strengthen critical thinking
and build resilience against information-based threats such as scams and
manipulation.</p>
