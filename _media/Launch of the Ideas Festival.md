Minister for Education (Singapore) Mr Chan Chun Sing, who highlighted the
importance of social sciences and humanities (SSH) research in enriching
our understanding of social issues, which are inherently complex and dynamic,
shaped by historical developments and disrupted by the latest technological
advances. Minister Chan also emphasised the Government's continued commitment
to supporting the development of the local SSH research ecosystem and scholarship
about Singapore and the region.</p>

<p>Minister Chan's address was followed by two keynote speeches by Professor
Lily Kong (President, Singapore Management University) and Professor Wang
Gungwu (University Professor, NUS), which underscored the importance of
social sciences and humanities research in all aspects of life, and as
a key strategic asset for Singapore in an era of disruptive change.</p>
