<p>The Ideas Festival was officially launched on 20 March 2024 at the National
University of Singapore (NUS), featuring an opening address by Minister
for Education (Singapore) Mr Chan Chun Sing, who highlighted the importance
of SSH research in enriching our understanding of social issues, which
are inherently complex and dynamic, shaped by historical developments and
disrupted by the latest technological advances. Minister Chan also emphasised
the Government's continued commitment to supporting the development of
the local SSH research ecosystem and scholarship about Singapore and the
region.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Minister Chan's address was followed by two keynote speeches by Professor
Lily Kong (President of the Singapore Management University) and Professor
Wang Gungwu (University Professor, NUS), which underscored the importance
of social sciences and humanities research in all aspects of life, and
as a key asset for Singapore to meet emerging challenges.</p>
