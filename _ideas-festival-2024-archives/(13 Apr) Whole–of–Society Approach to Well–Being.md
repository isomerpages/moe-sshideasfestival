<p>For most, general well-being has declined during the pandemic years, but
there are also reported improvement in general well-being for some.</p>
<p>This roundtable brings together researchers from different disciplines
to share highlights of their findings through different perspectives on
well-being, approaches and challenges of research conducted on this topic
in recent 3 years. Through each of their research project, researchers
will share how their academic research translates into meaningful involvement
with research end-users for mutual benefits, engagement with external stakeholders
and public participation, and collaboration with strategic stakeholders.
They will also share how academic research is able to create social impact
beyond academia, such as areas of health, public policy, culture, environment,
economy and standards of living, etc.</p>
