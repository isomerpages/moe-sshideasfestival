<p>Stigma against persons with mental health conditions (PMHCs) continues
to delay and in some cases, even prevent help-seeking, to deleterious effect.
Stories have an impact on perceptions and experiences of reality. Television
writers, novelists and playwrights can play an important role in changing
public attitudes towards PMHCs by developing nuanced and carefully crafted
representations of mental health conditions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This roundtable by NTU will introduce an SSRTG-funded project to develop
resources on mental health narrative ethical considerations for cultural
text producers in Singapore. These resources are being developed in consultation
with the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), based on close reading of local
mental health narratives, focus group discussions with PMHCs, and multidisciplinary
and cross-sector roundtables with representatives from different industries
and communities, such as mental health professionals and writers.
<br>
<br>Join us as we bring together academics, mental health professionals, patients,
caregivers and writers for an insightful discussion about the ethical considerations
involved in the cultural representation of mental health in Singapore.</p>
