<p><strong>Postgrad Networking Session </strong>
<br>It is no mean feat navigating the final stages of graduate school and
the period immediately following the completion of one’s PhD. How does
one grapple with the academic job market, address the questions of whether
and how to explore non-academic (alt-ac) paths, or handle those initial
years in a research position? In particular, how do those with graduate
degrees in the humanities and social sciences met those challenges?
<br>
<br>A strong support network, not just friends and family, but supportive
colleagues and mentors, is critical for anyone hoping to survive and thrive
in the late- and post-PhD phases.
<br>
<br>This postgraduate networking event, organized by the College of Integrative
Studies at SMU, is an opportunity for senior and graduating PhD students
in the humanities and social sciences to further build up their support
network.
<br>
<br>At this event, several researchers from the local universities will share
briefly about their experiences with early career research and/or alt-ac
options. Following that, during a networking session and over light refreshments,
senior postgraduate students will be able to strike up conversations informally
with these speakers, other senior scholars from the local universities
in attendance, and make connections with many postgraduate students in
cognate fields.</p>
